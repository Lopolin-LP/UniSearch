# UniSearch
Your favourite search engine + DuckDuckGo Bangs

- Two braincells
- The URL of your search engine provider

## Steps
1. Go to the [UniSearch Homepage](https://lopolin-lp.github.io/UniSearch/)
2. Enter the search engine provider of choice
   - make sure you use `{{{s}}}` to indicate where to place the search query

## Why
I like bangs, but DuckDuckGo slow and me no want DuckDuckGo anymore.

## Dev Info
When updating the bang.js, run it through `efficientBangs(bangs)` and put the return value (by right click + copy object) into bang.js, minify document, set to the global variable `bangs`.
